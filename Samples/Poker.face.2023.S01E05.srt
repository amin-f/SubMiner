2
00:00:06,214 --> 00:00:07,424
Two, three, four...

3
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:10,779
No, tha-tha-that's
just, that's ridiculous.

4
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:14,032
I'm telling you, it's a planet again.

5
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,950
Pluto was always a planet.

6
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:19,412
No, it wasn't. Now it is again.

7
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:20,914
This is like when you tried to tell me

8
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:22,165
a strawberry is a nut.

9
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:23,416
- Strawberry is a nut.
- No.

10
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:25,919
Anything with seeds on
the outside is a nut?

11
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,629
- A raspberry?
- A nut.

12
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:31,091
I hate your cunt heart.

13
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:35,261
- My tots are done.
- Oh, whoopie.

14
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:37,305
So, what are we going to watch tonight?

15
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:39,808
You want to keep going with "Euphorica"?

16
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:43,103
Kids who think they invented
fucking? No, thank you.

17
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:45,897
Oh shit. Goddamn
Fletchers have the remote.

18
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,483
Hey, Fletchers. We're
gonna watch "Shark Tank."

19
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:51,444
Majority rules the remote.

20
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:54,155
Majority rules my foot up your ass.

21
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:55,448
What is this garbage?

22
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,450
So you finish "Quaintsfordshire Murders"

23
00:01:57,492 --> 00:02:00,286
and now you want us to care
about who dies in Norway?

24
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:03,248
- Shh!
- The blonde did it.

25
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:05,166
Bitches.

26
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:12,132
Ooh, Irene, did you
charge your heartcuff?

27
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:13,925
I sure did, Billy.

28
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:18,138
That's hilarious
because, um, I'm showing:

29
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:21,057
Irene. Zero percent. No transmission.

30
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:23,351
Oh, you want to track my every movement,

31
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:25,603
so you know every time
I go to the bathroom

32
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:27,689
so you can jerk it to the knowledge

33
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:28,940
that I'm pooping.

34
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,066
It's not a GPS, Irene,

35
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:31,317
all it does is track your vital signs.

36
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:33,695
Not gonna chip me like some dog.

37
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:34,738
Woof!

38
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,575
Last chance.

39
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:41,327
Last chance to sign up for the zoo trip.

40
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:44,330
Oh, sure. Great.

41
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:46,833
Oh, wait, though.

42
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:49,336
Will we get back in time
to change our diapers

43
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:51,921
and to watch "Teletubbies"?

44
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:54,466
We're not fuckin' toddlers, Betty.

45
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:56,176
We've seen emus before.

46
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:57,510
If you can't make an effort

47
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:59,929
to be a more positive
community presence,

48
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:02,307
I may have to report

49
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:05,310
your illegal drug plants
to the administration.

50
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:06,519
No, no, no, no.

51
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:09,272
- No, no, no.
- Our life-saving medicine.

52
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:11,107
I know you don't have glaucoma.

53
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:13,026
And I, and I hate this

54
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:15,028
witchy Chinese game you're playing.

55
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,237
What are these, runes?

56
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:17,364
That's right, Betty.

57
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:21,034
We're Satanists who love drugs.

58
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:26,414
What a fucking cop.

59
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:31,127
All right now.

60
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:33,046
So we have you on our third floor.

61
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:35,215
That's our medical care unit.

62
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:38,051
I can give you a full
tour of the facilities.

63
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:40,553
And get you set up on
our heartcuff system.

64
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:43,264
But I'll let you get settled in first.

65
00:03:57,445 --> 00:03:59,781
You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?

66
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,746
We have to kill that motherfucker.

67
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,762
We happy?

68
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:48,872
Watch out, Earnhardt.

69
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:49,956
This ain't bumper cars.

70
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:52,709
I am so sorry. Wait a minute, Irene.

71
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:54,836
I guess I was just going
a little bit too fast.

72
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:56,087
- You all right?
- Yeah.

73
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,298
Mario Andretti over here.

74
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:28,745
Joyce, can you wheel
me over to the shitter?

75
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,374
- You have to go again?
- Ugh.

76
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:25,135
Hurry it up in there.

77
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:26,344
The bus is here.

78
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,555
The animals aren't going anywhere.

79
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:30,890
We can't miss the orangutan show.

80
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:32,017
She's very impressive.

81
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,853
Betty, you think Velcro is impressive.

82
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:48,510
I'm so glad...

83
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:51,012
you came back.

84
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:20,542
It's 11:10. The bus is going to leave.

85
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,253
I got to piss. What the
hell is she doing in there?

86
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:25,380
I don't know what to tell you people.

87
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:26,548
She has diarrhea.

88
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,425
That's it. I've had it.

89
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:29,466
The bus is ready.

90
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,136
Betty. Betty!

91
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:33,722
Oh. Good.

92
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:35,682
You gonna help me wipe?

93
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:39,185
Because my crevices have crevices.

94
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:40,937
- Excuse me.
- Finally!

95
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:02,334
Big deal.

96
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,585
Attention.

97
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:05,545
Would our guests from
Mossy Oaks retirement

98
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:07,380
please meet the zookeeper liaison

99
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:09,299
in the primate area.

100
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:11,509
Melanie is performing now.

101
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:17,807
Okay. I think this is good.

102
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:20,185
- Right here? Okay.
- Hmm.

103
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:22,103
Here. Let's do this.

104
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:25,315
Okay. You ready?

105
00:09:25,357 --> 00:09:27,734
Yeah. I'm good.

106
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:30,445
- You don't look ready.
- I'm just... I'm good. Just...

107
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,920
Girl?

108
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,296
- You good?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

109
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:49,631
Take, take this off.

110
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,219
I'm not getting a pulse.

111
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,637
Go, go!

112
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:00,141
Charging.

113
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,353
Clear.

114
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,270
And clear.

115
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,108
Mm-hmm.

116
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:25,625
Oh dear, who is that?

117
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:27,627
Uh, new guy from 312, Ben.

118
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:29,170
Heart attack.

119
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:15,175
Does the perfect murder exist?

120
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:17,719
This, I have asked the owls.

121
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,478
Shh!

122
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,481
- Hey, do you mind?
- Sorry.

123
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:32,484
Hey, hey, hey. Don't
worry about the Fletchers.

124
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,861
Oh, the Fletchers. Thanks.

125
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:36,571
I got to say, they seem very hard-core.

126
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:37,614
What are they, Dutch?

127
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:39,407
No, just into murder,

128
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:41,242
very rude.

129
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:43,578
Now, me, I would never tell a lady

130
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,580
when to stop sucking.

131
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,836
What the fuck, dude?

132
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:53,129
Pete,

133
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:55,048
stop pestering the new girl, come on.

134
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:58,051
And don't forget to sign up
for the zoo trip next week.

135
00:11:59,094 --> 00:12:01,471
That is a very pervy guy.

136
00:12:01,513 --> 00:12:03,640
- It's Pervy Pete.
- Explains it.

137
00:12:03,682 --> 00:12:05,558
Steer clear of his entire gang,

138
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,811
Chlamydia Cal and Gonorrhea Greg.

139
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:08,978
They're creeps.

140
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,480
Well, at least truth
in advertising, huh?

141
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:12,982
Actually, I think it's
Greg that has Chlamydia.

142
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:17,028
Aha. So, kind of an
Iceland-Greenland scenario.

143
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,781
I know everything about
everyone who lives here.

144
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:22,200
Just stick with me. I'm Betty.

145
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:24,119
Hopefully not Botulism Betty.

146
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,081
Most people don't realize all the things

147
00:12:28,123 --> 00:12:29,290
you can do with an Instapot.

148
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:32,043
Cheesecake. Denver omelet.

149
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:35,213
I once made a beef
bourguignon in 22 minutes.

150
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:40,301
Ladies, would you please turn

151
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:42,429
your ghetto blaster down?

152
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:49,060
Watch out for these two.

153
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:51,062
They're felons.

154
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:53,398
- And junkies.
- Right.

155
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,234
Ah. Real den of iniquity, this place.

156
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:58,611
Whatever you do, stay away

157
00:12:58,653 --> 00:13:00,405
from Joyce and Irene.

158
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:08,079
I don't want to know.

159
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:09,748
I really don't.

160
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,332
- Ah!
- That was awful.

161
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:12,751
You guys are trouncing me,

162
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,502
'cause you are a pair of shuffle sharks.

163
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:17,672
Your form is off. You're too tense.

164
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:18,840
- You need to loosen up.
- What? No. I'm loose.

165
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,593
That's my whole thing. Am I not loose?

166
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:24,137
- You should try rage therapy.
- What's that?

167
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:33,688
That shit feels good.

168
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,482
Hey, you, come on. Reach deep.

169
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:37,359
It starts in the labia.

170
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,819
Mm-mm. You know...

171
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:41,696
I think

172
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:43,698
that I'm fine with bottling.

173
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,034
I... you don't want to see me unbottled.

174
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:49,287
You can't, you can't
handle the unbottled.

175
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:51,331
Well, the thing that got us

176
00:13:51,373 --> 00:13:52,874
through our stint at Bedford Hills.

177
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:54,292
Yeah.

178
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:57,337
Crazy. You kids were
really inside, huh? Upstate.

179
00:13:57,379 --> 00:13:59,589
We were political prisoners.

180
00:13:59,631 --> 00:14:01,007
Wow, no shit.

181
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:02,550
No shit whatsoever.

182
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:04,386
How'd you get into that?

183
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:07,931
I was in college. It
was a turbulent time.

184
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:10,809
- Oh yeah. I mean, the '60s.
- Did you hear that?

185
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,477
- The '70s, bitch.
- Oh, right.

186
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:14,270
You know, I was going to say the '90s

187
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:15,438
because of all the flannel.

188
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,065
You'd have been better off going there.

189
00:14:17,107 --> 00:14:18,274
I'm so sorry,

190
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:20,151
just a pair of tweens
and a shuffleboard.

191
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:23,780
Whoa-whoa!

192
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:25,782
- Irene!
- Yeah, that's right.

193
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:29,494
Very straight edge.

194
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:31,496
I mean, not at all what I was expecting.

195
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:33,248
Yeah, I was on the straight and narrow

196
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,333
before I met my guardian devil.

197
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,375
- What?
- Yeah.

198
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:37,376
She was shouting down

199
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:38,795
some coeds on the quad,

200
00:14:38,837 --> 00:14:40,505
and I heard what she was saying

201
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:41,965
and my brain opened up.

202
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:44,092
World didn't make sense before that...

203
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:46,136
and then it did.

204
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:47,387
It's adorable.

205
00:14:47,429 --> 00:14:49,055
She brought me into the group.

206
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:52,559
Changed my life.

207
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:56,187
Introduced me to Gabriel.

208
00:14:57,439 --> 00:14:59,024
Ooh-la-la.

209
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:01,651
Who's this Gabriel? What, who's Gabriel?

210
00:15:01,693 --> 00:15:03,528
Gabriel started the group.

211
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,530
He recruited me and...

212
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:08,867
- ... he trained us, inspired us.
- Trained us.

213
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:12,120
He was our... he was our guiding light.

214
00:15:12,162 --> 00:15:13,371
I see what's happening here.

215
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:14,581
I'm getting a real magnetic vibe.

216
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:16,041
Like a cult leader with pretty eyes.

217
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:17,709
Ehh, he looked like
one of those white guys

218
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:19,919
you see in the picture frames
that you buy from Target.

219
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:21,171
Excuse me.

220
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:22,464
- No excuse you.
- Irene, you're nuts. Uh-uh.

221
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:25,884
Excuse me. Gabriel was hot.

222
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,260
Okay, I'm gonna split the diff.

223
00:15:27,302 --> 00:15:30,722
I'm gonna picture my high
school French teacher.

224
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:33,475
One thing's for sure though...

225
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:36,227
Dick like a fire hydrant!

226
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:39,147
Oh, good for Gabriel.
Everyone enjoys it.

227
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:41,316
Yes. Well done, Gabriel.

228
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:43,068
Gabriel was more than that.

229
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:45,236
You know, he, he knew that we could make

230
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:46,571
the world a better place

231
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:49,991
if we hold the assholes to account.

232
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:51,576
You feel me?

233
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:53,411
- I feel you.
- That was Gabriel.

234
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:54,621
I feel you, I'm...

235
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:56,706
I am picking up what
you're putting down.

236
00:15:56,748 --> 00:15:59,751
And I gotta say, you two
are the coolest motherfuckers

237
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:01,836
I have met in a very long time.

238
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:05,006
Seriously. I mean, sorry
to curse, but necessary.

239
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:07,217
- Cool.
- So what happened after that?

240
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:09,135
What happened after he recruited you?

241
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:12,806
We went to work.

242
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:26,986
I got to say, it sounds like

243
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:28,947
I was born in the wrong time.

244
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,824
We were starting to get a reputation.

245
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:32,617
A band even put our picture

246
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:34,119
on the cover of their album,

247
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,203
The Droopy Hues.

248
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:37,455
The Droopy Hues.

249
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:39,958
Gosh, what an awful name for a band.

250
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,335
- Were they any good?
- Awful.

251
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:10,822
You mean like...

252
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:13,658
Uh, Charlie. Yes.

253
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,744
But... together.

254
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:18,872
Okay. The Euphorica generation

255
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:20,832
can't handle the heat?

256
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:23,251
Euphoria? How old do you think I am?

257
00:17:23,293 --> 00:17:24,961
Don't forget to charge
your heartcuff, Irene.

258
00:17:25,003 --> 00:17:26,504
And don't forget to take your head

259
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:28,298
out of the man's ass, Billy.

260
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,927
You know you don't live here, right?

261
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:34,346
Is that Elaine's cardigan?

262
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:35,513
You know what, I found it

263
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:37,015
in the, uh, the lost and found,

264
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:38,558
which I got to say is stellar.

265
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,684
So much stuff in there.

266
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:41,186
No, it's, uh, it's actually not lost.

267
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:44,189
Um, she had an aneurysm and died...

268
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:46,483
- in that sweater.
- Yeah, it smells like Icy Hot

269
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:48,818
and a life well lived.

270
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:51,029
She's gone full Cocoon.

271
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:52,697
Billy, will you marry me?

272
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:55,158
Hey, Billy, Billy.

273
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:59,412
So, you're living, you're loving,

274
00:17:59,454 --> 00:18:00,955
you're changing the world.

275
00:18:01,873 --> 00:18:03,208
What went wrong?

276
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:07,837
Oh, we were planning
our most direct action.

277
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:11,257
It was the real revolution.

278
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:13,385
We were gonna set the world on fire.

279
00:18:15,887 --> 00:18:17,639
We were on the cusp.

280
00:18:17,681 --> 00:18:19,265
That's when it always happens, right?

281
00:18:33,822 --> 00:18:34,823
It was a raid.

282
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:41,162
So that's how...

283
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:44,457
that's how you got arrested?

284
00:18:44,499 --> 00:18:47,585
Their plan wasn't to arrest us.

285
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:51,881
They came in there with guns blazing.

286
00:18:51,923 --> 00:18:55,468
We all tried to run, but...

287
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:00,056
Irene...

288
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,688
Irene was brave.

289
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:09,774
She couldn't leave Gabriel behind.

290
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:11,693
You, on the ground, on the ground!

291
00:19:13,695 --> 00:19:16,031
Hey, look at me, I got you.

292
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:17,240
Hey, I got you, okay.

293
00:19:17,282 --> 00:19:19,117
- I can't feel my legs.
- I got you.

294
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:20,869
I can't feel my legs.

295
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,454
I can't feel my legs.

296
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,872
I can't feel my legs.

297
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:35,592
They took, took everything.

298
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:39,179
My legs...

299
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:43,516
our freedom.

300
00:19:44,601 --> 00:19:45,894
And Gabriel.

301
00:19:49,981 --> 00:19:51,858
Just hope he didn't suffer.

302
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,529
But we'll never know.

303
00:19:57,197 --> 00:19:58,323
Ah.

304
00:19:59,324 --> 00:20:00,784
Phew.

305
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:03,870
Fucking Christ, man. You two.

306
00:20:03,912 --> 00:20:06,873
All that loss and you
keep moving forward,

307
00:20:07,499 --> 00:20:08,917
living your lives.

308
00:20:10,043 --> 00:20:11,836
Forgive and forget, right?

309
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:13,505
Oh, sweetie.

310
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:14,546
No.

311
00:20:17,384 --> 00:20:19,219
We never forgive.

312
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:30,772
We have yoga, swimming,

313
00:20:30,814 --> 00:20:32,565
Pilates, if that interests you.

314
00:20:33,692 --> 00:20:35,985
All right, if I can get your signature

315
00:20:36,027 --> 00:20:37,028
right here.

316
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:40,198
Sign on the bottom.

317
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,325
All right. We have you in a suite

318
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:45,412
on our third floor,
our medical care unit.

319
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:47,455
I can give you a full
tour of the facilities

320
00:20:47,497 --> 00:20:49,541
and get you set up with
our heartcuff system.

321
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:52,168
But, uh, I'll let y'all
get settled in first.

322
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:54,212
Okay, what else, what else, uh...

323
00:20:54,254 --> 00:20:57,173
okay, I think you guys are ready
to come on up to the third floor.

324
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:58,425
Let's go! Actually,

325
00:20:58,466 --> 00:21:00,301
I have someone to carry
those bags for you.

326
00:21:00,343 --> 00:21:01,678
Charlie!

327
00:21:09,978 --> 00:21:11,354
All right, Uncle Ben,

328
00:21:11,396 --> 00:21:13,815
I've got to hit the road.

329
00:21:14,733 --> 00:21:15,775
I, uh...

330
00:21:17,402 --> 00:21:18,611
love you.

331
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,457
I'm his nephew.

332
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:32,083
Sure.

333
00:21:35,587 --> 00:21:37,714
Want me to, uh, close that window?

334
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:39,883
No, I like the cold.

335
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:41,092
Ah!

336
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,430
So, where are you from?

337
00:21:46,431 --> 00:21:47,766
Nowhere.

338
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:49,642
You got any visitors?

339
00:21:49,684 --> 00:21:51,436
Uh, 'cause I can let the front know,

340
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:53,188
this place can be a real maze.

341
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:54,439
I got no one.

342
00:22:01,738 --> 00:22:03,239
All right.

343
00:22:03,281 --> 00:22:04,449
I'll get this.

344
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,410
Welcome.

345
00:22:31,601 --> 00:22:33,937
Gabriel.

346
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:47,575
Even when I saw you,

347
00:22:48,535 --> 00:22:50,495
I couldn't believe it.

348
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:52,831
We both couldn't.

349
00:22:54,499 --> 00:22:56,710
But I knew your eyes.

350
00:22:59,504 --> 00:23:03,425
I've thought about
this moment for years,

351
00:23:03,466 --> 00:23:07,554
imagining what I'd
do and what I'd say...

352
00:23:09,222 --> 00:23:11,016
if I ever saw you again.

353
00:23:12,767 --> 00:23:14,853
And now that I finally found you...

354
00:23:18,523 --> 00:23:19,649
I don't know.

355
00:23:19,691 --> 00:23:21,317
We would have looked for you.

356
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:24,320
We never would have stopped looking.

357
00:23:24,362 --> 00:23:26,031
We thought you were dead.

358
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:31,703
But you got away.

359
00:23:33,246 --> 00:23:34,831
Thank God you got away.

360
00:24:15,914 --> 00:24:18,416
I didn't have a choice.

361
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:19,834
Things had gotten out of hand,

362
00:24:19,876 --> 00:24:21,586
and I, I couldn't stop them.

363
00:24:21,628 --> 00:24:22,879
Not on my own.

364
00:24:25,924 --> 00:24:28,885
I know I did the right thing.

365
00:24:28,927 --> 00:24:31,721
But it kills me that I had to hurt

366
00:24:31,763 --> 00:24:33,098
the ones I loved.

367
00:24:34,724 --> 00:24:36,184
It kills you?

368
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:40,480
Man, we lost...

369
00:24:40,522 --> 00:24:43,274
decades of our lives.

370
00:24:44,693 --> 00:24:49,322
I lost my goddamn legs.

371
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,574
I know.

372
00:24:51,616 --> 00:24:52,867
I'm sorry.

373
00:24:53,576 --> 00:24:54,828
That's why I'm here.

374
00:24:57,622 --> 00:24:59,332
I have this dream

375
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:02,252
where I see...

376
00:25:02,293 --> 00:25:05,755
the two of you in a
crowd, and I follow you.

377
00:25:05,797 --> 00:25:10,260
For miles. For miles and
miles until my feet bleed.

378
00:25:10,301 --> 00:25:12,178
I try to explain myself.

379
00:25:12,971 --> 00:25:14,389
But you never turn around.

380
00:25:15,348 --> 00:25:17,100
In 50 years...

381
00:25:18,309 --> 00:25:19,894
you never turn around.

382
00:25:20,562 --> 00:25:22,814
And I realized that

383
00:25:22,856 --> 00:25:24,357
the dream would never change

384
00:25:24,399 --> 00:25:26,317
until I told you the truth.

385
00:25:29,237 --> 00:25:30,822
Can you please forgive me?

386
00:25:43,084 --> 00:25:44,753
Sure, Gabriel.

387
00:25:48,256 --> 00:25:49,674
We forgive you.

388
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:08,485
You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?

389
00:26:08,526 --> 00:26:11,279
We have to kill that motherfucker.

390
00:26:11,321 --> 00:26:15,116
It's 11:10. The bus is going to leave.

391
00:26:15,158 --> 00:26:18,161
I got to piss. What the
hell is she doing in there?

392
00:26:18,203 --> 00:26:20,330
Look, I don't know
what to tell you people.

393
00:26:20,372 --> 00:26:22,457
She has diarrhea.

394
00:26:22,499 --> 00:26:25,585
Bullshitting about shitting
Rock on, ladies. Great.

395
00:26:25,627 --> 00:26:27,379
The bus is ready.

396
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,297
All aboard for the zoo.

397
00:26:29,339 --> 00:26:31,633
Attention. Would our guests

398
00:26:31,675 --> 00:26:33,510
from Mossy Oaks Retirement please...

399
00:26:33,551 --> 00:26:36,346
Hey, ladies. I almost forgot.

400
00:26:36,388 --> 00:26:37,639
Check it out.

401
00:26:37,681 --> 00:26:39,265
I scored it on Etsy.

402
00:26:39,307 --> 00:26:40,767
Droopy Hues.

403
00:26:40,809 --> 00:26:43,895
Okay, let's settle this. Which
one is our friend Gabriel?

404
00:26:44,729 --> 00:26:46,022
Um...

405
00:26:47,691 --> 00:26:48,691
Huh.

406
00:26:48,692 --> 00:26:49,943
Not what I was expecting.

407
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:52,904
But you did not over-hype the D-train.

408
00:26:52,946 --> 00:26:55,407
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Uh...

409
00:26:55,448 --> 00:26:57,951
All right, so you guys
coming to see this chimp show?

410
00:26:57,992 --> 00:27:00,370
No, you know, we're going to pass on it.

411
00:27:00,412 --> 00:27:03,373
We, uh, we have an allergy.

412
00:27:03,415 --> 00:27:05,375
To monkey dander.

413
00:27:05,417 --> 00:27:07,252
- Yeah.
- Ah. Bullshit.

414
00:27:07,293 --> 00:27:08,712
And big mistake.

415
00:27:08,753 --> 00:27:10,630
Enjoy gettin' high.

416
00:27:10,672 --> 00:27:12,132
And catch you on the flipside.

417
00:27:12,173 --> 00:27:14,384
- On the flipside, baby.
- All right, ladies.

418
00:27:14,426 --> 00:27:15,844
Let's go, down here.

419
00:27:15,885 --> 00:27:18,430
Wait for me, chimpanzee.

420
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:22,475
Now, Melanie,

421
00:27:22,517 --> 00:27:25,145
can you tell me what time it is?

422
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:32,736
2:23.

423
00:27:32,777 --> 00:27:34,362
- Excellent!
- Wow!

424
00:27:34,404 --> 00:27:35,905
That's amazing.

425
00:27:36,364 --> 00:27:37,615
Oh man.

426
00:27:37,657 --> 00:27:39,951
Joyce and Irene are really missing out.

427
00:27:43,204 --> 00:27:44,414
Deviants.

428
00:27:47,417 --> 00:27:48,501
Very uptight.

429
00:27:52,547 --> 00:27:53,923
We weren't even gone half a day.

430
00:27:53,965 --> 00:27:55,216
What was it this time?

431
00:27:55,258 --> 00:27:57,177
Oh, new guy. Ben.

432
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:00,138
- Oh shit.
- Uh, excuse me.

433
00:28:01,639 --> 00:28:02,974
Man!

434
00:28:04,267 --> 00:28:05,268
Who was Ben?

435
00:28:06,227 --> 00:28:07,604
That's a,

436
00:28:07,645 --> 00:28:09,064
that's a question for each of us

437
00:28:09,105 --> 00:28:10,440
to answer for ourselves.

438
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,360
And so,

439
00:28:14,361 --> 00:28:16,363
let us take a moment of silence

440
00:28:16,404 --> 00:28:18,531
to reflect on Ben's life

441
00:28:19,657 --> 00:28:22,118
and what he meant to each of us.

442
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:25,121
Psst. Hey, fake nephew.

443
00:28:25,163 --> 00:28:27,457
Sorry for your loss, man. Scoot over.

444
00:28:27,499 --> 00:28:29,000
Why are you...

445
00:28:29,834 --> 00:28:31,002
I'm a real nephew.

446
00:28:31,044 --> 00:28:33,838
Oh. Listen, I don't
care why you're lying.

447
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,256
You know, if it was

448
00:28:35,298 --> 00:28:36,966
a sugar daddy situation or whatever,

449
00:28:37,008 --> 00:28:38,593
It wasn't... Oh.

450
00:28:40,387 --> 00:28:41,638
He was my uncle.

451
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,847
Oh, sugar uncle?

452
00:28:42,889 --> 00:28:44,766
Regular uncle. No sugar.

453
00:28:44,808 --> 00:28:46,976
Aren't you, like, the bellhop?

454
00:28:47,018 --> 00:28:50,689
You didn't know him. Why are you here?

455
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:52,691
Well, he just, he seemed sad.

456
00:28:52,732 --> 00:28:56,069
Like, he didn't have anyone, you know.

457
00:28:56,111 --> 00:28:59,406
I figured I could show up here at least,

458
00:28:59,447 --> 00:29:00,573
you know.

459
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:06,454
The truth is, oh, I mean,
I shouldn't tell you this,

460
00:29:06,496 --> 00:29:08,873
but he's dead now, so it's probably...

461
00:29:11,918 --> 00:29:15,046
Ben was in witness protection.
I was his case agent.

462
00:29:19,718 --> 00:29:22,429
- Wow. No shit.
- Hmm.

463
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:24,931
So you're, like, FBI?

464
00:29:24,973 --> 00:29:27,392
Technically. I mean, yes, I am.

465
00:29:27,434 --> 00:29:29,102
It's just...

466
00:29:29,144 --> 00:29:32,188
I thought I'd be, you know,
fighting the war on terror.

467
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:33,940
Instead, I'm getting groceries for guys

468
00:29:33,982 --> 00:29:36,317
whose testimony was
relevant before I was born.

469
00:29:37,485 --> 00:29:39,946
Never mind that I'm
fluent in fucking Urdu.

470
00:29:39,988 --> 00:29:41,906
- Oh wow.
- Yeah.

471
00:29:41,948 --> 00:29:43,116
Thank you.

472
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:49,080
So was he, like, Mafia?

473
00:29:49,122 --> 00:29:50,707
Did he do wet work?

474
00:29:50,749 --> 00:29:52,334
I've said too much already.

475
00:29:54,461 --> 00:29:57,839
Gosh, where do I know this guy from?

476
00:29:57,881 --> 00:29:59,341
Was he on TV or something?

477
00:29:59,382 --> 00:30:00,467
I don't think so.

478
00:30:04,387 --> 00:30:06,598
Fire hydrant.

479
00:30:06,639 --> 00:30:08,558
Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

480
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,769
- Droopy Hues.
- Droop... What?

481
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:13,313
Yeah, that's Gabriel. Look at his dick.

482
00:30:13,355 --> 00:30:15,940
Y-yes. What? How do you know that?

483
00:30:15,982 --> 00:30:18,109
Well, not to brag, but I'm friends

484
00:30:18,151 --> 00:30:19,694
with these pretty super cool chicks,

485
00:30:19,736 --> 00:30:20,987
Joyce and Irene, who live here,

486
00:30:21,029 --> 00:30:23,114
and they were telling
me about their old flame.

487
00:30:23,156 --> 00:30:25,784
- Ow, dude.
- Joyce Carter and Irene Smothers.

488
00:30:25,825 --> 00:30:27,077
Yes, Joyce and Irene.

489
00:30:27,118 --> 00:30:29,162
Joyce Carter and Irene
Smothers are here?

490
00:30:29,204 --> 00:30:31,581
Yeah, they're my buds. We Mahjong. Why?

491
00:30:32,832 --> 00:30:34,501
Fuck.

492
00:30:46,805 --> 00:30:48,223
Joyce, Irene.

493
00:30:48,264 --> 00:30:50,767
Special Agent Luca Clark, FBI.

494
00:30:50,809 --> 00:30:52,435
Come with me, please.

495
00:30:58,483 --> 00:30:59,734
Charlie.

496
00:30:59,776 --> 00:31:01,903
They use illegal drugs.

497
00:31:01,945 --> 00:31:04,656
They have zero respect for quiet time.

498
00:31:04,698 --> 00:31:06,366
And at the zoo,

499
00:31:06,408 --> 00:31:09,703
they were doing some
kind of sexual zapping.

500
00:31:09,744 --> 00:31:11,788
And at Peter's birthday party,

501
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:13,790
they both had two pieces of cake.

502
00:31:13,832 --> 00:31:15,291
And I, I didn't get any.

503
00:31:15,333 --> 00:31:17,293
Yes, ma'am. Thank you for sharing

504
00:31:17,335 --> 00:31:19,754
all of this very helpful information.

505
00:31:19,796 --> 00:31:22,132
Those two are no good.

506
00:31:25,719 --> 00:31:28,221
What a fucking cop.

507
00:31:28,263 --> 00:31:30,807
Okay, so the heartcuff
data pins the time of death

508
00:31:30,849 --> 00:31:32,642
when Joyce and Irene were at the zoo,

509
00:31:32,684 --> 00:31:34,144
so they didn't kill Gabriel.

510
00:31:34,185 --> 00:31:36,438
Well, I could have told you that.

511
00:31:36,479 --> 00:31:38,314
Well, normally, if someone
in witness protection meets

512
00:31:38,356 --> 00:31:42,152
the people he, you know, witnessed

513
00:31:42,193 --> 00:31:43,653
and then suddenly drops dead...

514
00:31:43,695 --> 00:31:46,281
Wait, are you saying that
Ben or Gabriel or whatever,

515
00:31:46,322 --> 00:31:48,450
he's the guy that ratted them out.

516
00:31:48,491 --> 00:31:50,076
Oh God. I'm just so, so dumb.

517
00:31:50,118 --> 00:31:51,995
He said he wanted to transfer here,

518
00:31:52,037 --> 00:31:53,997
and I said, "Mossy Oaks. Sounds nice."

519
00:31:54,039 --> 00:31:55,623
I did zero research whatsoever.

520
00:31:55,665 --> 00:31:58,293
Oh, yes. No, that is not very thorough.

521
00:31:58,335 --> 00:32:00,378
But, uh, don't beat yourself up.

522
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:02,297
'Cause guess what, they didn't kill him.

523
00:32:02,339 --> 00:32:04,507
I mean, with the zoo and the time,

524
00:32:04,549 --> 00:32:05,842
and I know them,

525
00:32:05,884 --> 00:32:07,510
these guys are cool as shit.

526
00:32:07,552 --> 00:32:09,554
Okay? They are not murderers.

527
00:32:09,596 --> 00:32:13,016
Charlie, Joyce and Irene
are not cool as shit.

528
00:32:13,058 --> 00:32:14,559
They're domestic terrorists.

529
00:32:14,601 --> 00:32:15,643
All right, Mr. Man.

530
00:32:15,685 --> 00:32:17,354
Do you know what they were planning

531
00:32:17,395 --> 00:32:19,105
- when they were arrested?
- Yeah, I do.

532
00:32:19,147 --> 00:32:21,816
They were doing some kind of a big
march or something. So that's, uh...

533
00:32:21,858 --> 00:32:23,068
There were going to blow up a meeting

534
00:32:23,109 --> 00:32:24,652
of the Model United Nations

535
00:32:24,694 --> 00:32:26,696
with bombs they made out of

536
00:32:26,738 --> 00:32:27,989
Pressure cookers.

537
00:32:28,031 --> 00:32:30,200
Huh. Wait, I'm sorry, they were going

538
00:32:30,241 --> 00:32:32,202
to blow up the UN?

539
00:32:32,243 --> 00:32:34,037
The Model UN.

540
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:36,373
As in high schoolers pretending

541
00:32:36,414 --> 00:32:38,708
to be the UN for extra credit.

542
00:32:39,959 --> 00:32:42,212
Okay. Is that better or worse?

543
00:32:42,253 --> 00:32:44,339
Because, I mean, that's
not the real UN, right?

544
00:32:44,381 --> 00:32:46,174
It's so much worse. They...

545
00:32:47,258 --> 00:32:49,135
They were going to kill children

546
00:32:49,761 --> 00:32:51,137
with explosives.

547
00:32:55,475 --> 00:32:56,475
Huh.

548
00:32:57,227 --> 00:32:58,645
- Yikes.
- Yeah.

549
00:32:59,562 --> 00:33:01,189
- Anything comes up.
- Yeah...

550
00:33:01,231 --> 00:33:03,400
You should keep that. I don't need that.

551
00:33:03,441 --> 00:33:04,734
Maybe they didn't kill Gabriel,

552
00:33:04,776 --> 00:33:07,237
but watch your back, Charlie.

553
00:33:07,278 --> 00:33:09,698
Those two women are extremely dangerous.

554
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:29,634
That was intense.

555
00:33:29,676 --> 00:33:31,052
I felt like I was in
"Wolf of Wall Street"

556
00:33:31,094 --> 00:33:33,054
all of a sudden and not the fun parts.

557
00:33:34,097 --> 00:33:35,765
Are you a rat, Charlie?

558
00:33:35,807 --> 00:33:37,392
Eh?

559
00:33:37,434 --> 00:33:39,769
They grilled us for an hour.

560
00:33:39,811 --> 00:33:41,938
And you know we hate pigs.

561
00:33:42,689 --> 00:33:44,065
And rats.

562
00:33:46,443 --> 00:33:48,194
Hey, hey, hey.

563
00:33:48,236 --> 00:33:51,239
I hate pigs and rats, too.

564
00:33:51,281 --> 00:33:53,074
And snakes.

565
00:33:53,116 --> 00:33:56,828
Half the Chinese zodiac
is no good in my book.

566
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:02,042
Hey, guys, it's me, okay. It's Charlie.

567
00:34:02,083 --> 00:34:04,419
I didn't know the guy was a
fed until we started talking.

568
00:34:04,461 --> 00:34:05,628
He just sprung it on me.

569
00:34:06,421 --> 00:34:07,630
I'm no stoolie.

570
00:34:08,798 --> 00:34:10,508
If I had known who Ben was,

571
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:11,843
I would have steered clear.

572
00:34:11,885 --> 00:34:13,678
Wait, why didn't you just tell me,

573
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,680
you know, that, that Ben was Gabriel?

574
00:34:15,722 --> 00:34:17,307
How do you think we feel?

575
00:34:18,767 --> 00:34:20,894
Knocks on our door
the other night, says,

576
00:34:20,935 --> 00:34:24,189
hey, I'm alive, and I betrayed you both.

577
00:34:25,648 --> 00:34:28,318
Geez. How'd that go?

578
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,320
We told him we forgave him.

579
00:34:31,696 --> 00:34:33,823
Hah. Good.

580
00:34:33,865 --> 00:34:36,868
Forgiveness. All right.

581
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:40,080
Oh, uh, I did want to
ask you guys about this,

582
00:34:40,121 --> 00:34:42,624
this crazy thing, it's probably nothing.

583
00:34:42,665 --> 00:34:44,876
So apparently, you guys were going to,

584
00:34:44,918 --> 00:34:46,461
I don't know, blow up some kind of

585
00:34:46,503 --> 00:34:50,090
United Nations for babies or something.

586
00:34:50,131 --> 00:34:52,467
Charlie, what you have to understand

587
00:34:52,509 --> 00:34:54,219
about these elite prep school kids,

588
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,553
they were the offspring

589
00:34:55,595 --> 00:34:58,139
of the reigning fascists of the day.

590
00:34:58,181 --> 00:35:00,183
And we wanted to send a message

591
00:35:00,225 --> 00:35:04,771
to the next generation of war criminals.

592
00:35:06,648 --> 00:35:08,650
I see.

593
00:35:08,692 --> 00:35:10,819
Just to be crystal clear here,

594
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:14,030
so, uh... we're talking about...

595
00:35:14,948 --> 00:35:16,700
blowing up high school kids?

596
00:35:16,741 --> 00:35:17,992
Like, with bombs?

597
00:35:19,703 --> 00:35:21,287
It was a different time.

598
00:35:31,673 --> 00:35:33,049
Uh-huh.

599
00:35:34,175 --> 00:35:35,218
All right.

600
00:35:36,553 --> 00:35:38,013
I got to say, I really feel like

601
00:35:38,054 --> 00:35:39,848
we glossed over some details here.

602
00:35:39,889 --> 00:35:42,559
You know who you're beginning

603
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,436
to sound a lot like?

604
00:35:47,564 --> 00:35:48,898
- Betty.
- Betty.

605
00:35:51,026 --> 00:35:52,026
Right.

606
00:35:52,819 --> 00:35:54,237
I got to say, you know,

607
00:35:54,279 --> 00:35:56,906
you're starting to sound
a lot less like Hoffman

608
00:35:56,948 --> 00:35:58,950
and a lot more like Manson, so...

609
00:35:59,993 --> 00:36:01,161
Oh shit.

610
00:36:02,078 --> 00:36:03,246
Wait, uh,

611
00:36:04,289 --> 00:36:05,457
did you guys...

612
00:36:07,584 --> 00:36:08,918
Did you kill Ben?

613
00:36:10,712 --> 00:36:12,839
You wearing a wire, Charlie?

614
00:36:13,381 --> 00:36:14,424
Hmm?

615
00:36:14,466 --> 00:36:17,135
Hey, Agent Fuckface. Go suck an egg.

616
00:36:17,177 --> 00:36:19,220
All right, man, stop talking to my tits.

617
00:36:19,262 --> 00:36:21,014
You know what? I...

618
00:36:21,056 --> 00:36:23,350
Fuck! I just... I really
thought you guys were, like,

619
00:36:23,391 --> 00:36:25,226
these two super-cool women.

620
00:36:25,268 --> 00:36:27,520
You know, all this talk about

621
00:36:27,562 --> 00:36:28,897
standing up for what you believe in

622
00:36:28,938 --> 00:36:31,399
and holding the assholes accountable...

623
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,118
Oh wow.

624
00:36:44,621 --> 00:36:46,247
You're the assholes.

625
00:36:46,664 --> 00:36:47,999
Got it.

626
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:06,351
You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?

627
00:37:08,311 --> 00:37:09,479
Yeah.

628
00:37:13,149 --> 00:37:14,359
Is that a Skarsgard?

629
00:37:14,401 --> 00:37:16,277
You think everyone is a Skarsgard.

630
00:37:16,319 --> 00:37:18,947
Well, everyone is a Skarsgard.

631
00:37:18,988 --> 00:37:22,158
Hey, hey, you guys watch a
lot of murder shows, right?

632
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,284
Shh!

633
00:37:23,326 --> 00:37:25,120
I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.

634
00:37:25,161 --> 00:37:27,831
Uh, I was just wondering, um,

635
00:37:27,872 --> 00:37:31,292
do you know of any
easily accessible poisons

636
00:37:31,334 --> 00:37:34,462
that would trigger an
undetectable heart attack?

637
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,298
Potassium chloride.

638
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:41,344
Standard go-to, third
season "Lillyflay Manor."

639
00:37:41,386 --> 00:37:42,929
Calcium chloride.

640
00:37:42,971 --> 00:37:44,305
Epinephrine.

641
00:37:44,347 --> 00:37:45,849
Sodium nitrate.

642
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:47,767
Common gardening ingredient.

643
00:37:47,809 --> 00:37:51,021
Of course, it's hard to top

644
00:37:51,062 --> 00:37:52,313
ricin.

645
00:37:52,355 --> 00:37:54,315
Ooh, ricin.

646
00:37:54,357 --> 00:37:56,151
Eh, what about the, the gardening one?

647
00:37:56,192 --> 00:37:57,485
Oh sure.

648
00:37:57,527 --> 00:38:00,155
Couple of cc's of sodium nitrate

649
00:38:00,196 --> 00:38:02,323
and you're deader than dirt.

650
00:38:02,365 --> 00:38:04,159
And the best thing is

651
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:07,328
it's a naturally occurring
compound in the body.

652
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:09,956
Trying to find that in an autopsy,

653
00:38:09,998 --> 00:38:12,083
forget about it.

654
00:38:12,125 --> 00:38:14,210
Right on. Gardening.

655
00:38:17,547 --> 00:38:19,591
Okay. Okay. As you were.

656
00:38:20,925 --> 00:38:22,302
Uh-huh.

657
00:38:23,178 --> 00:38:24,637
Uh-huh.

658
00:38:25,722 --> 00:38:26,890
Sodium nitrate.

659
00:38:26,931 --> 00:38:27,932
Oh.

660
00:38:27,974 --> 00:38:29,309
Yeah, I guess so.

661
00:38:29,351 --> 00:38:31,186
If that's what she, uh,

662
00:38:31,227 --> 00:38:33,355
uses for her ganja situation.

663
00:38:33,396 --> 00:38:35,357
Man, what's she been doing with it?

664
00:38:35,398 --> 00:38:36,858
I gave her a week's worth on Monday,

665
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,610
then another week's worth on Wednesday.

666
00:38:38,651 --> 00:38:41,029
You tell her don't shoot that stuff.

667
00:38:41,071 --> 00:38:42,280
It'll mess you up.

668
00:38:47,118 --> 00:38:48,995
- Fake nephew.
- Charlie. Hey.

669
00:38:49,037 --> 00:38:50,789
So, listen, if I, uh,

670
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:52,374
if I had some information

671
00:38:52,415 --> 00:38:55,001
about Ben's death, is that something,

672
00:38:55,043 --> 00:38:57,796
like, could you keep my name
out of the whole business?

673
00:38:57,837 --> 00:39:00,757
Yes, that's what I... my job
is literally witness protection.

674
00:39:00,799 --> 00:39:02,842
It turns out that Joyce had access

675
00:39:02,884 --> 00:39:05,595
to some sodium nitrate the
day before Ben was killed.

676
00:39:05,637 --> 00:39:07,889
Oh. Your last guy got whacked?

677
00:39:07,931 --> 00:39:09,099
What is that? Am I, uh...

678
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:10,558
Sorry, am I on speakerphone?

679
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,352
Yes. No, that's Gino the Bull.

680
00:39:12,394 --> 00:39:14,396
It probably wasn't even murder.

681
00:39:14,437 --> 00:39:16,398
Probably? Marone...

682
00:39:16,439 --> 00:39:18,233
this ain't inspiring

683
00:39:18,274 --> 00:39:19,693
a lot of confidence, you know.

684
00:39:19,734 --> 00:39:21,444
Charlie, how could they have killed him

685
00:39:21,486 --> 00:39:22,904
with sodium nitrate?

686
00:39:22,946 --> 00:39:24,406
Time of death was 2:23.

687
00:39:24,447 --> 00:39:26,241
They were at the zoo with you.

688
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:30,370
2:23.

689
00:39:30,412 --> 00:39:31,746
Two-two-three. Whoa!

690
00:39:31,788 --> 00:39:34,124
Whoa, dude, dude, that's
the time of the monkey.

691
00:39:34,165 --> 00:39:35,542
What of the what?

692
00:39:35,583 --> 00:39:37,961
Oh, th-th-th-the monkey at the zoo.

693
00:39:38,003 --> 00:39:39,754
The show, you know, it tells time.

694
00:39:39,796 --> 00:39:42,048
Melanie. Melanie. She's amazing.

695
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:43,299
And when I saw this show,

696
00:39:43,341 --> 00:39:45,176
the time the monkey told was 2:23.

697
00:39:45,218 --> 00:39:47,053
That's a weird coincidence, huh?

698
00:39:47,095 --> 00:39:48,680
Uh, I mean,

699
00:39:48,722 --> 00:39:50,765
do you think that maybe she's, uh...

700
00:39:50,807 --> 00:39:52,767
you think she's some
kind of a monkey pre-cog?

701
00:39:52,809 --> 00:39:56,396
Pre-cog. Like "Minority
Report" with monkeys?

702
00:39:56,438 --> 00:39:58,148
No, I do not.

703
00:39:58,189 --> 00:39:59,691
I would watch that movie, though.

704
00:39:59,733 --> 00:40:01,317
Wait, wait, wait. No.

705
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:03,319
So, Joyce and Irene,
they skipped the show.

706
00:40:03,361 --> 00:40:04,863
Fuck, yes, they could have...

707
00:40:04,904 --> 00:40:07,365
Ah shit, no, it's not
enough time for the drive,

708
00:40:07,407 --> 00:40:10,744
but maybe they faked the time of death.

709
00:40:10,785 --> 00:40:12,954
Charlie, remember what
I said about those two?

710
00:40:12,996 --> 00:40:14,289
- Be careful with those two...
- Yeah. Hey, Billy!

711
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:15,457
Let me call you back, okay.

712
00:40:15,498 --> 00:40:17,751
Billy. Hey, how you been?

713
00:40:17,792 --> 00:40:20,712
I was wondering, could
I get a quick peek

714
00:40:20,754 --> 00:40:23,631
at the data from Ben's
robo-arm-bracelet?

715
00:40:23,673 --> 00:40:26,009
No, absolutely not. That'd
be a HIPAA violation.

716
00:40:26,051 --> 00:40:29,012
Oh yeah, and I'm hip-a
to what you're saying.

717
00:40:29,054 --> 00:40:31,848
But, uh, maybe just this once.

718
00:40:32,766 --> 00:40:34,184
Okay.

719
00:40:34,225 --> 00:40:35,518
- I shouldn't be doing this, but okay.
- Thank you.

720
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,145
Look, you can see the whole story.

721
00:40:37,187 --> 00:40:39,230
He had a cardiac spike at 2:23,

722
00:40:39,272 --> 00:40:40,523
and then the vitals just stopped.

723
00:40:40,565 --> 00:40:41,900
And after that, we tried to defib him,

724
00:40:41,941 --> 00:40:43,318
but he was already gone.

725
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:46,154
Let me ask you something,
is it possible to, uh,

726
00:40:46,196 --> 00:40:47,822
I don't know, fake this?

727
00:40:47,864 --> 00:40:49,991
Like, could you go in and change it?

728
00:40:50,033 --> 00:40:51,701
- No, no, it's hard data.
- Huh.

729
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,663
What's this, this blip at 11:10?

730
00:40:55,705 --> 00:40:58,249
- Maybe he was startled.
- No, but look.

731
00:40:58,291 --> 00:41:01,336
I mean, the heartbeat, it changes.

732
00:41:01,378 --> 00:41:04,631
I mean, it's a different
speed, strength.

733
00:41:04,673 --> 00:41:07,175
It's almost like he
switched hearts or something.

734
00:41:07,217 --> 00:41:08,426
That is weird.

735
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:10,220
11:10

736
00:41:10,261 --> 00:41:12,180
That's right around when we were leaving

737
00:41:12,222 --> 00:41:13,473
for the zoo.

738
00:41:14,974 --> 00:41:16,059
Ah...

739
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,605
She bullshitted about shitting.

740
00:41:20,647 --> 00:41:23,358
All right, Luca, are you ready
for some grade-A figuring?

741
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,527
So she climbed up the plant ladder,

742
00:41:25,568 --> 00:41:27,862
swapped out the heartcuff,
killed him at 11:10.

743
00:41:27,904 --> 00:41:30,824
Then she climbed back
down, went to the zoo,

744
00:41:30,865 --> 00:41:33,576
and faked the cardiac spike
during the monkey show.

745
00:41:33,618 --> 00:41:35,745
- Bing-bang-boom.
- Bing-bada-boom.

746
00:41:35,787 --> 00:41:38,039
- It's nuts.
- But plausible.

747
00:41:38,081 --> 00:41:39,708
Plausible's not grounds
for an arrest warrant.

748
00:41:39,749 --> 00:41:42,502
I need something hard and firm

749
00:41:42,544 --> 00:41:43,795
if I'm going to ride this one.

750
00:41:43,837 --> 00:41:46,548
Now you're speaking my language.

751
00:41:46,589 --> 00:41:47,966
Also, Charlie, for this theory to work,

752
00:41:48,008 --> 00:41:49,718
either Joyce or Irene would have needed

753
00:41:49,759 --> 00:41:51,052
to simulate a heart attack.

754
00:41:51,094 --> 00:41:52,137
I looked at that spike.

755
00:41:52,178 --> 00:41:53,555
That isn't doing jumping jacks.

756
00:41:53,596 --> 00:41:55,223
That's a real cardiac event.

757
00:41:55,265 --> 00:41:56,725
I don't know how you fake that.

758
00:41:57,559 --> 00:41:59,352
I gotta get back to you.

759
00:42:01,021 --> 00:42:04,691
Heya, Pete, uh, let
me ask you a question.

760
00:42:04,733 --> 00:42:07,819
Do you know anything
about sexual zapping?

761
00:42:09,612 --> 00:42:11,823
You speak of electro-play.

762
00:42:11,865 --> 00:42:14,075
Kinky stuff. Not for the faint of heart.

763
00:42:14,117 --> 00:42:17,120
All you need is a
taser and an open mind.

764
00:42:19,289 --> 00:42:20,498
Ugh.

765
00:42:23,918 --> 00:42:25,545
- Hello?
- Uh, Betty.

766
00:42:25,587 --> 00:42:27,088
Uh, it's your old friend Charlie.

767
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:28,757
Oh. What do you want?

768
00:42:28,798 --> 00:42:30,592
Oh, listen, I think you
might have been right

769
00:42:30,633 --> 00:42:32,260
about, uh, Joyce and Irene.

770
00:42:32,302 --> 00:42:33,636
I told you.

771
00:42:33,678 --> 00:42:35,638
- Felons and junkies.
- Yeah, yeah, I know.

772
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:38,850
Listen, I, I need to know
what you saw at the zoo.

773
00:42:38,892 --> 00:42:41,478
You mentioned something
about a sexual zapping.

774
00:42:41,519 --> 00:42:42,771
Well, yes.

775
00:42:42,812 --> 00:42:44,981
I was buying a hat like a normal person

776
00:42:45,023 --> 00:42:48,943
when I saw Joyce and Irene
looking extra suspicious.

777
00:42:50,236 --> 00:42:52,947
They were in the hothouse
pleasuring each other

778
00:42:52,989 --> 00:42:54,574
with some kind of electro-dildo.

779
00:42:56,576 --> 00:42:59,120
And the worst of it is
I missed the monkey show,

780
00:42:59,162 --> 00:43:01,289
which was the whole
reason that I organized

781
00:43:01,331 --> 00:43:03,833
the trip in the first place.

782
00:43:03,875 --> 00:43:06,711
Betty, that's it. That's
it. I think we got 'em.

783
00:43:06,753 --> 00:43:09,214
I'm glad somebody is finally listening.

784
00:43:09,255 --> 00:43:11,132
Like I told Irene this morning,

785
00:43:11,174 --> 00:43:12,801
"The zoo is no place

786
00:43:12,842 --> 00:43:15,845
"to practice your twisted
masochistic fetishes,

787
00:43:15,887 --> 00:43:19,474
and the FBI will hear about it."

788
00:43:19,516 --> 00:43:22,143
Wait, Betty, you told Irene all this.

789
00:43:22,185 --> 00:43:24,145
Uh, just an hour ago.

790
00:43:25,188 --> 00:43:26,189
Oh.

791
00:43:26,231 --> 00:43:27,816
Hold on just a minute, Charlie.

792
00:43:27,857 --> 00:43:30,902
My Instapot is making
funny noises. Hold on.

793
00:43:30,944 --> 00:43:32,987
Pressure cooker. No, no, Betty.

794
00:43:33,029 --> 00:43:34,406
Betty, you got to get out of there.

795
00:43:34,447 --> 00:43:36,157
Betty! Betty!

796
00:43:36,199 --> 00:43:37,367
Evacuate!

797
00:43:54,342 --> 00:43:55,635
You're so silly.

798
00:43:55,677 --> 00:43:56,928
- Oh God.
- Oh, my God.

799
00:43:56,970 --> 00:43:59,389
Ooh, I think we may be pushing our luck.

800
00:43:59,431 --> 00:44:01,474
You up for a change of scenery?

801
00:44:01,516 --> 00:44:03,893
Look, you think they got, uh, senior

802
00:44:03,935 --> 00:44:05,603
living in Bolivia?

803
00:44:05,645 --> 00:44:06,645
Mmm.

804
00:44:10,025 --> 00:44:11,401
Charlie.

805
00:44:22,287 --> 00:44:23,913
How can we help you?

806
00:44:24,748 --> 00:44:26,416
Betty told me everything,

807
00:44:26,458 --> 00:44:28,251
uh, about how she saw you two

808
00:44:28,293 --> 00:44:31,546
tasing each other in the hothouse.

809
00:44:31,588 --> 00:44:33,840
That's how you tricked
the nurses into thinking

810
00:44:33,882 --> 00:44:36,551
that Ben was having a heart attack

811
00:44:36,593 --> 00:44:41,014
uh, when he'd really
been dead for hours.

812
00:44:41,056 --> 00:44:44,851
Pretty clever. But
you missed one detail.

813
00:44:44,893 --> 00:44:47,354
What might that be?

814
00:44:47,395 --> 00:44:51,399
Ben's heart monitor
recording went totally flat

815
00:44:51,441 --> 00:44:54,319
after your tasing stunt

816
00:44:54,361 --> 00:44:55,945
at 2:23.

817
00:44:57,197 --> 00:44:58,531
The time of the monkey.

818
00:44:59,908 --> 00:45:02,869
But the nurses tried to revive
him with a defibrillator.

819
00:45:02,911 --> 00:45:05,830
If he'd really been wearing
his heartcuff monitor,

820
00:45:05,872 --> 00:45:08,249
it would have registered those shocks.

821
00:45:08,291 --> 00:45:10,251
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

822
00:45:10,293 --> 00:45:12,128
- Ain't that some shit.
- Mm-hmm.

823
00:45:13,588 --> 00:45:14,923
And all this for a motherfucker

824
00:45:14,964 --> 00:45:17,217
who sent us to prison for 30 years?

825
00:45:17,258 --> 00:45:19,427
You deserved it then

826
00:45:19,469 --> 00:45:21,304
and you deserve it now.

827
00:45:21,346 --> 00:45:24,474
Wax up your shuffleboard pucks, ladies.

828
00:45:25,809 --> 00:45:29,312
As soon as I tell my new FBI buddy

829
00:45:29,354 --> 00:45:31,940
about all this, well...

830
00:45:31,981 --> 00:45:35,610
Yeah, man, you're going
right back to Bedford.

831
00:45:35,652 --> 00:45:39,781
So you haven't told him all of this yet?

832
00:45:43,827 --> 00:45:45,620
The fuck?

833
00:45:45,662 --> 00:45:47,497
- Ah!
- Bitch!

834
00:45:52,919 --> 00:45:54,754
Fuck!

835
00:45:56,798 --> 00:45:58,216
Fucking bitch.

836
00:46:05,348 --> 00:46:06,558
Fucking millennial.

837
00:46:06,599 --> 00:46:08,184
I'm a cusper, you fucking psycho.

838
00:46:08,226 --> 00:46:11,604
And I draw the line at
fighting little old ladies.

839
00:46:13,982 --> 00:46:16,860
That's how we did it in Bedford, bitch.

840
00:46:28,038 --> 00:46:29,539
What the fuck!

841
00:46:31,708 --> 00:46:35,712
I'll fucking kill you, you motherfucker.

842
00:46:38,131 --> 00:46:40,258
Ah!

843
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:43,219
You talc'd me, you fucking whore.

844
00:46:51,811 --> 00:46:54,189
- Get the fucking poison!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

845
00:46:56,066 --> 00:46:57,525
Keep her held down.

846
00:46:57,567 --> 00:46:58,860
Ah.

847
00:46:58,902 --> 00:47:00,570
Ah. Ah.

848
00:47:04,115 --> 00:47:05,825
Come on, move.

849
00:47:08,453 --> 00:47:09,746
Right there. Yeah.

850
00:47:09,788 --> 00:47:11,581
Oh! Fuck.

851
00:47:11,623 --> 00:47:13,208
- Oh no!
- Don't you try it.

852
00:47:13,249 --> 00:47:14,876
Don't you fucking try it.

853
00:47:14,918 --> 00:47:17,045
Put it down. Put it down.

854
00:47:17,087 --> 00:47:18,588
Down!

855
00:47:20,090 --> 00:47:21,341
Oh! Oh!

856
00:47:28,014 --> 00:47:30,892
Uh, I think we broke her.

857
00:47:32,352 --> 00:47:34,479
Let's get this shit done.

858
00:47:34,521 --> 00:47:35,772
Oh!

859
00:47:39,025 --> 00:47:41,027
Oh shit. Yeah.

860
00:47:41,069 --> 00:47:43,071
- Oh, thank God.
- Oh, shit.

861
00:47:43,113 --> 00:47:44,239
Oh, fuck.

862
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:45,824
Stop right there. Stop.

863
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:51,079
What a fuckin' cop.

864
00:47:51,121 --> 00:47:52,205
All right.

865
00:48:13,727 --> 00:48:16,479
Well, Charlie Cale, you
have great instincts.

866
00:48:16,521 --> 00:48:18,273
You ever think about joining the FBI?

867
00:48:18,314 --> 00:48:21,192
Well, I'm not really
about helping the man.

868
00:48:21,234 --> 00:48:24,738
Although, uh, did you
guys ever get my email

869
00:48:24,779 --> 00:48:27,699
about, uh, Kazimir Caine?

870
00:48:27,741 --> 00:48:29,325
"You guys" meaning who?

871
00:48:29,367 --> 00:48:32,162
FBI at FBI dot gov.

872
00:48:32,203 --> 00:48:34,164
I don't even know if that's a thing,

873
00:48:34,205 --> 00:48:37,250
but the offer stands.

874
00:48:37,292 --> 00:48:40,420
You ever get in a jam,
you have my number.

875
00:48:44,341 --> 00:48:45,675
Toodles.

876
00:48:53,016 --> 00:48:54,434
Oh God.
